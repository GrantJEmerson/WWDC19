# WWDC19
Dompel is the playground that I developed for the WWDC 2019 scholarship. Dompel is an interactive 3D (or binaural) audio experience that allows for the positioning of various instruments or tracks in a real world environment. Augmented reality is utilized to provide visual stimulus to the 3D audio reference points. I developed Dompel using the frameworks of AVFoundation, UIKit, and ARKit.
